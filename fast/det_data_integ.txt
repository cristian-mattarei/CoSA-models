det_data_integ.json should be deterministic

The Verilog was verified by JG as deterministic.

In the original counterexample trace, one of the registers did not have equal initial states
because JG relies on the reset signal to set initial state and does not handle the notation:

reg Q = INIT

That's fixed now and the determinism property passes.

The register that influences data_out_vld (and produced the counterexample trace) is the following
in the coreir version:

ff_en$__DOLLAR__procdff__DOLLAR__266$reg0
